1. Honestly not a great KVM switch. Keyboard shortcuts to switch inputs *need* to come from the HID USB port, but that means I can't attach ISOs via the JetKVM. 
   Workaround for now is a RP2040-based device I have connected to the HID port that emulates a keyboard and communicates with the JetKVM via UART serial.
   The JetKVM is connected to the non-HID USB port for USB mass storage and non-input-switching keystrokes.
   (Todo: version control and document this somewhere...)
